GoLogo is a plugin for the JetBrains IDE [__GoLand__](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/go/). This plugin replaces the 
beloved GoLang gopher icon in the file explorer and editor tabs (which is the default with the JetBrains 
[__Go plugin__](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9568-go)) with the official GoLang logo icon. 

### Installation

This plugin is designed primarily for __GoLand__. If you want to use it in any other JetBrains IDE, make sure to have the official JetBrains [Go Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9568-go) installed for GoLogo to work (and make sense in the first place).
